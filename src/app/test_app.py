#what should be tested for the gateway-api
    # status of gateway api itself
    # fastapi-users functionalities
        # create / register user (with adm rights)
        # sign in / log off
        # delete user
        # check user database / print it out
    # Connection to MLFlow server (Mlflow-client)
        # show model-registry content (models) --> Print it out. (pprint)
        # Delete entire model-registry aka all models (and show / test that its deleted) --> Preparation for the end-to-end-tets / integration tests // OR: Get the latest version for later assertion of training models.
    # Workflow testing (tested on the endpoints / sub-apis!)
        #### HACK: If mlfow testing is not implemented, just delete the content (but not the folder itself!) of mlruns folder on main level.
        # train model RFC on PTBDB (Must be version 1 if the model-registry is deleted --> assert Version 1 hardcoded!) with bad model_params --> Low accuracy! assert it with the model_registry
        # train model RFC on Ptbdb (Version 2) with good model_params --> High accuracy
        # update the RFC_Ptbdb Model to deployment --> Version 2 must be set as deployment --> Assert it
        # predict with RFC deployment model on Ptbdb --> Must give the correct status etc, assert it just like in test_predict.py, but not as exhausting (just the correct prediction)

### ONGOING NOTES ###
# the script works inside docker (gateway-api creates database and tables via lifespan handler, and forcing the creation here does not produce an error)
# but in github actions, the users table is not found in the database? is the execution of the lifespan handler different? Must the database be exposed via postgres?
# Both produce the same warning: coroutine create_db_and_tables was never awaited --> It is never executed in this test_app.py script?
