#This is the file for hakan to test the pytest functions and github actions / MLFlow integration

#use a specific syntax  for pytets...
def test_endpoint_status():
    #Write a function to call each endpoint
    #start with the /status endpoint --> This might be overkill to start, because the fastapi has to be running, so either write more code to start it up ("python -m main") or just write a dummy

    

    return succes / no success


def test_model_loading():
    #write some dummy function for the functions that are used inside the endpoints (is this redundantn?)

#--> This file has to be called by some kind of .yaml file in .github/workflows on push --> "Unit_tests.yaml"



#What is important`?
# -NOT Actual functioning, but clear structure and the communication betewen this script, the target scripts / functions, github actions and MLFlow MUST be working.
